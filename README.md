# Portfolio-update


This is my persionalized Web Dev Portfolio site for my current skills, projects and goals.

A bit about me...

 I'm Nikita Johnson (or 'Nicky', for short), and I'm a Front-End Web Developer with a strong background in visual design. I much prefer to define myself by the work I aspire to do to keep my goals and dreams thriving.

I love to learn, grow by challenging myself and participate in interesting things that make a difference. I'm quietly confident with an insatiable, natural curiousity for the world, and constantly working on improving my skills day by day.
